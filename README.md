Was It Saturday?
================

Have you ever had a date in your head, and won­dered to your­self, “Did that hap­pen on a Sat­ur­day?” Then, did you wish that there was a web app ded­i­cated to just that, but not a calendar?

Oh, you didn’t? Not at all? Well, I did, and that’s what this project is.

About the Project
-----------------

Let me give you some back­ground. We were work­ing on a project where the cre­ative direc­tion called for the very quick, spe­cific knowl­edge of whether a date hap­pened on a Saturday.

Obvi­ous tech­niques would involve click­ing over to a cal­en­dar, and brows­ing or search­ing for the date in par­tic­u­lar. This works great for a small num­ber of dates: one, two, a dozen, twenty-five. What if you have hun­dreds of dates to check? Then it might be nice to have a lit­tle app that gives you the skinny on the Saturday.

Demo
----

Demo the app at [awayken.com/saturday](http://awayken.com/saturday).

Code
----

The app is writ­ten in CFML and uses a Google web­font. Oth­er­wise, there’s noth­ing sig­nif­i­cant about it. Fork it at [github.com/awayken/Was-It-Saturday](http://github.com/awayken/Was-It-Saturday).

Never won­der whether ’twas Sat­ur­day again.
